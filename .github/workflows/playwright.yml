    # Strategy matrix allows running tests in multiple environments (e.g., different browsers)
    strategy:
      matrix:
        # We define one dimension: the browser to test on.
        # This will create 3 jobs: one for each browser.
        browser: [chromium, firefox, webkit]
      # Let the other browsers continue if one fails
      fail-fast: false

    # The steps for the job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the code from the repository
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js (Playwright requires it)
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 'lts/*' # Use the latest LTS version
          cache: 'npm'

      # Step 3: Install dependencies (this will cache them for speed)
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # Step 4: Install Playwright Browsers
      - name: Install Playwright browsers
        run: npx playwright install --with-deps ${{ matrix.browser }}
        # '--with-deps' is crucial for Linux systems to install browser dependencies

      # Step 5: Run your Playwright tests
      - name: Run Playwright tests
        run: npx playwright test --project=${{ matrix.browser }} --reporter=list
        # This runs tests only for the current browser in the matrix
        # e.g., for the 'chromium' job, it runs `--project=chromium`
        env:
          # If your tests need a base URL, you can set it here.
          # For the SauceDemo site, you don't need it as you use the full URL.
          # BASE_URL: http://localhost:3000

      # Step 6: ONLY IF THE TESTS FAILED: Upload Playwright artifacts (report, traces, videos)
      - name: Upload Playwright report
        if: failure() # This step only runs if a previous step failed
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
